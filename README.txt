Assignment 4 : Parts System w/ Database Compatibility Part 2



Notes by Daniel Gardner and Stephen Leija



Our project implements a tabbed view, so to view the four different views, click on the desired tab.
All of the input in the system is used as Strings for the database. Clicking on a part or item in the above list automatically fills in the fields in the lower half of the JPanel for easy editing. The records in the database get called every time an update is made, so the two lists always reflect what is currently in the database.
The Product Template Part Detail view requires users to enter quantity, a part number, and a product description. This allows the system to identify which id's to use for the product_detail database.
